  ## User Story
* AS AN avid traveler
* I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
* SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

 Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information.

 The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. Its built and deployed to Heroku.
